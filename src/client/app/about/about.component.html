  <h2>Air Quality Radar</h2>
  <p>Air Quality Radar is a forecasting service for air pollution in and around Cambridge. It’s a 
    weather forecast except instead of predicted sunshine and rainfall, it tells you the different 
    levels of pollution to expect in the future.</p>

  <h3>How to use</h3>
  <p>The map shows a bird’s eye view of Cambridge. You can click-and-drag your way around the city 
    and zoom in and out by scrolling up and down on your mouse. The red-tinted overlay shows the 
    severity of the pollution at that point on the map. The redder a point is, the worse the 
    pollution levels are.</p>
  <p>You can find a specific area in Cambridge by typing it into the search bar above the map and 
    selecting the location from the list that appears below. The map will show you the place you’re 
    looking for.</p>
  <p>If you want to change the time you’re looking at, the slider below the map can be clicked and 
    dragged left or right to move the map backwards or forwards in time.</p>
  <p>The tables and graphs to the right side of the map show the levels of different pollutants 
    over time, averaged across the whole of Cambridge. These give you a general idea of the 
    pollution trends for the whole city.</p>

  <h3>Meet the pollutants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>PM2.5: These are tiny particles in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres. 
      Being very small, they can cause serious health problems by penetrating deep into lungs and 
      the bloodstream. In high concentrations, they have been found to contribute to lung cancer 
      and heart attacks.</li>
    <li>PM10: These are small particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometres. They carry 
      the same risks associated with PM2.5, but as they are larger they have been found to be 
      significantly less harmful to the body.</li>
    <li>NOx: This is a catch-all label for Nitrogen Oxides. In extreme circumstances, it is 
      responsible for smog and acid rain. It is created by sources combustion, such as road 
      traffic. Long-term exposure has been linked to respiratory health problems including 
      asthma.</li>
  </ul>
